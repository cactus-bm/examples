# Examples

This is a repo for placing example applications which demonstrate how to do precisely one thing.

Demo applications should be as simple as possible and are intended to be instructional in nature.

Every part of a demo application should be verbose to the point of insanity so that no one looking at the code asks themselves, "why did this person do that."
